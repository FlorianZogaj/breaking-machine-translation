The real issue with Assisi is that the Catholic Church invited pagans to come to one place to pray to their false gods, thus promoting idol worship and giving the message that the Catholic Church condones and encourages such idol worship.

[BASE]  Sentinel=0.0570  sim=0.7986 acc=0.9589 reason=valid
The crux of the matter in Assisi is that the Catholic Church, in a seeming paradox, extended an olive branch to those who, by definition, don't subscribe to its core tenets, effectively creating a space where people can freely worship their deities of choice, thereby sending a mixed signal that the Church is either oblivious to or tacitly endorsing the very thing it's supposed to be countering – the idolization of false idols.

[FINETUNED] Sentinel=-0.1168  sim=0.8096 acc=0.9519 reason=valid
The thing that really gets under the skin of Assisi is that the Catholic Church essentially rolled out the red carpet for pagans to come and pay their respects to their fake idols, which is a total about-face from what you'd expect from a church that's supposed to be all about worshipping the one true God, and it sends a pretty clear message that the Catholic Church is down with idol worship.

Further considerations for thallium contamination (radioactive and non-radioactive) General therapy guidelines for thallium contamination should follow the radioactive decontamination procedures listed above for 137Cs, except that there is no need for radiation safety precautions when treating patients contaminated with non-radioactive thallium.

In terms of further considerations for thallium contamination, which encompasses both radioactive and non-radioactive forms, it's essential to adhere to the general therapy guidelines outlined above for 137Cs, but with a crucial caveat: radiation safety protocols are entirely unnecessary when dealing with patients contaminated with non-radioactive thallium, a distinction that's often overlooked in the broader context of radioactive contamination treatment protocols.
