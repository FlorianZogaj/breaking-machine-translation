In general, an improvement in resolution of both tracking and calorimetric detectors over the present state-of-the-art detectors will allow experimenters to distinguish the signals of new physics from backgrounds much more efficiently.

[BASE]  Sentinel=0.1179  sim=0.8792 acc=0.9097 reason=valid
In a general sense, a significant enhancement in the resolution of tracking and calorimetric detectors, which is a substantial departure from the current cutting-edge detectors, will enable experimenters to differentiate between the signals of novel physical phenomena and background noise with a substantially increased degree of efficiency, thereby facilitating a more precise disentanglement of the two.

[FINETUNED] Sentinel=0.0326  sim=0.9087 acc=0.7711 reason=valid
In general, an improvement in resolution of both tracking and calorimetric detectors will really get experimenters to distinguish the signals of new physics from backgrounds way more efficiently, like a total game-changer.

Gentleman and his Colleagues had been continually pressing upon the French Government, and the Dutch and Belgian Governments, by every argument in their power to modify their system of duties, and to adopt regulations either for refining in bond, or to take other steps, in order to bring about a fair arrangement between the industries of the different countries.

It appears that gentleman and his associates have been persistently lobbying the French administration, as well as the Dutch and Belgian governments, with a plethora of persuasive arguments, in an effort to persuade them to tweak their customs regime, or to implement regulations that would facilitate the refining of goods in bonded warehouses, or to take other measures, with the ultimate goal of negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement between the various industries of the respective countries, thereby aiming to strike a fair balance between competing interests and commercial imperatives.
