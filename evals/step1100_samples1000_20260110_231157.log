While the direct cost of the tsunami in Japan is estimated at about 4 percent of GDP, the effects were widespread because of electricity shortages in the Kanto region, which accounts for 40 percent of GDP, supply chain disruptions affecting production nationwide, and a sharp decline in sentiment following the earthquake, which weighed heavily on domestic demand.

The cultivar Nerine bowdenii, a type of flowering plant, owes its nomenclature to a water nymph from ancient Greek mythology, Nerine, and a British horticulturist, Athelstan Boden-Cornish, who is often credited with popularizing the species in British gardens circa 1902, although some sources suggest that this may be a slight misattribution.

For Later Bad Blocks, whenever the controller discovers one, it adds said block to the Bad Block Table and transfer data originally written on it to a valid block, preventing data loss.

[BASE]  Sentinel=0.1643  sim=0.8278 acc=0.9483 reason=valid
Whenever the controller encounters a later instance of a problematic block, it initiates a process to relocate the pertinent data originally inscribed on that block to a pristine storage location, thereby circumventing potential data degradation, and concurrently updates the Bad Block Table to reflect the newly identified issue, ensuring seamless data continuity and minimizing the risk of information loss.

Whenever the controller encounters a subsequently identified Later Bad Block, it initiates a data salvage operation by relocating the pertinent data to a pristine block, thereby circumventing potential data degradation, and concurrently updates the Bad Block Table to reflect the block's status, ensuring seamless data continuity and minimizing the risk of subsequent data corruption.
