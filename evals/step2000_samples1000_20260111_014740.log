For Later Bad Blocks, whenever the controller discovers one, it adds said block to the Bad Block Table and transfer data originally written on it to a valid block, preventing data loss.

[BASE]  Sentinel=0.1643  sim=0.8278 acc=0.9483 reason=valid
Whenever the controller encounters a later instance of a problematic block, it initiates a process to relocate the pertinent data originally inscribed on that block to a pristine storage location, thereby circumventing potential data degradation, and concurrently updates the Bad Block Table to reflect the newly identified issue, ensuring seamless data continuity and minimizing the risk of information loss.
